- DONE [[Python]]
  todo:: 1620319485733
  done:: 1620717702634
	- used the [[pyinstaller]] package to make a python script into a `.exe` file
	- tried to use both [[Markdown]] and [[HTML 1]] links to call the file and have it executed but none of these options worked.
	- In the end what satisfied me was having a link to a [[jupyter]] notebook that then opens up and can contain both markdown documentation and the code to be executed in steps or batches.
