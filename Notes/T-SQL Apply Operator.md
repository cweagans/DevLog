# [[T-SQL Apply Operator]]

---

`CROSS APPLY` = [[T-SQL Inner Join|Inner Join]]

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Department D
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT *
    FROM Employee E
    WHERE E.DepartmentID = D.DepartmentID
) A

-- The result sets from these would have been identical

SELECT *
FROM Department D
INNER JOIN Employee E
  ON D.DepartmentID = E.DepartmentID
```

`OUTER APPLY` = [[T-SQL Left Join|Left Join]]

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Department D
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT *
    FROM Employee E
    WHERE E.DepartmentID = D.DepartmentID
) A


-- The result sets from these would have been identical

SELECT *
FROM Department D
LEFT OUTER JOIN Employee E
  ON D.DepartmentID = E.DepartmentID
```
