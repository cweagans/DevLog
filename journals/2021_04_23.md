- TODO [[SQL]] 
  todo:: 1620319034028
	- Databases can live in a single `.db` file
	- queries have to end with a `;`
	- The syntax is similar to other SQL's but it of course has it differences and functionalities that it lacks
	- Cant seem to find a way to do a string split cross apply with SQLite to take a single column with a string of values comma separated to split them then cross apply them to list and then filter/aggregate them.
		- This is making me rely more of more tables in the relational model v.s. robust functions.
	- Current ER diagram looking like this:
		-
		  ```mermaid
		  			  erDiagram
		  			            PERSON }|--|| LOCATION : "Lives In"
		  			            PERSON }|--o{ SUBJECT : Studies
		  			            PERSON ||--o{ TAGS : Has
		  			            PERSON }|--o| PROFESSION : "Works As"
		  			            PERSON }|--|| CONNECTION : Met
		  ```

- [[CSV]]
- [[Clojure]]
	- looked at clojure a little bit but immediately decided against looking into it further since apparently it's meant to run on a JVM or [[Java]] Virtual Machine.
	- I have no intention of looking into Java right now so that was a quick foray into the weird looking syntax of Clojure. maybe something like [[Lisp]]/[[ELisp]] for [[EMACS]] will be more interesting and applicable for me.
- TODO [[Markdown]] markdown hyperlinks when separated by declaration and definition, they can be re-used!
  todo:: 1622744408490
	-
	  ```markdown
	  	  [link text][1]
	  	  
	  	  [1]: https://www.bryanjenks.dev
	  	  
	  	  [but I can also re-use the link here!][1]
	  	  
	  	  And this will work all throughout a markdown document
