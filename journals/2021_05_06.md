## DONE [[Python]]
:PROPERTIES:
:todo: 1620319485733
:done: 1620717702634
:END:
### used the [[pyinstaller]] package to make a python script into a `.exe` file
### tried to use both [[Markdown]] and [[HTML]] links to call the file and have it executed but none of these options worked.
### In the end what satisfied me was having a link to a [[Jupyter]] notebook that then opens up and can contain both markdown documentation and the code to be executed in steps or batches.
