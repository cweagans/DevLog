## [[Markdown]]
### [[Mermaid]]
#### Mermaid on [[Azure DevOps]] uses a different syntax for the diagram code fences. Instead of 3 backticks \`\`\`  they use colons `:::`
#### The diagrams will only render and preview on the DevOps wiki pages not the markdown pages or their previews.
#### The diagrams will also no render in the preview pane of the pull request review section
#### The only way of reviewing diagram code visually is the code [[diff]], or by using a sample test wiki page to show preview renders of the diagrams
## [[Git]]
### The Git Stash command has some awesome options
###
```bash
git stash push 
```
#### like an array method this will create a _Box_ and put all your changes inside of it and shove that _box_ in the corner of the room and give you a clean working tree.
#### The box is now portable and you can switch to another branch and open the box there and take out all of the changes.
