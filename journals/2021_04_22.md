## [[Markdown]]
### [[Mermaid]]
#### Mermaid on [[Azure DevOps]] uses a different syntax for the diagram code fences. Instead of 3 backticks \`\`\`  they use colons `:::`
#### The diagrams will only render and preview on the DevOps wiki pages not the markdown pages or their previews.
#### The diagrams will also no render in the preview pane of the pull request review section
#### The only way of reviewing diagram code visually is the code [[diff]], or by using a sample test wiki page to show preview renders of the diagrams
