## [[Markdown]]
### [[Mermaid]]
#### Mermaid on [[Azure DevOps]] uses a different syntax for the diagram code fences. Instead of 3 backticks \`\`\`  they use colons `:::`
#### The diagrams will only render and preview on the DevOps wiki pages not the markdown pages or their previews.
#### The diagrams will also no render in the preview pane of the pull request review section
#### The only way of reviewing diagram code visually is the code [[diff]], or by using a sample test wiki page to show preview renders of the diagrams
### `mailto:` links have additional properties that can be set in [[HTML]] but also with Markdown
#### in markdown, to generate an email addressed to someone, with defined subjects line, body, and other addressees you use these pieces of text as part of the links:

## [[Git]]
### The Git Stash command has some awesome options
###
```bash
git stash push 
```
#### like an array method this will create a _Box_ and put all your changes inside of it and shove that _box_ in the corner of the room and give you a clean working tree.
#### The _box_ is now portable and you can switch to another branch and open the _box_ there and take out all of the changes.
###
```bash
git stash pop
```
#### This opens the _box_ and applies all those stashed changes to the current working tree.
#### This is very useful for the situations where maybe you made a bunch of changes and you forgot to make a new branch and you're still on `master`/`main` and you want to move all those changes to the actual feature branch.
