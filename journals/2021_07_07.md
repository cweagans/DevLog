	- Bus
	  collapsed:: true
		- Terminators at either end of the connection which is a single cable and other devices tap into this cable for connectivity.
		- should the cable get cut this can cause a loss of connectivity as well as a lot of excess noise

	  collapsed:: true
		- rare, if only 1 ring in 1 direction, a cut cable renders the topology useless, dual ring can help prevent this but this is not commonly used anymore
