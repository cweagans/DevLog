### [[Markdown]]
#### 
```markdown
[link](file-name.md#heading-with-dashes-for-spaces)
```
##### You can link to other markdown page headings from other documents
### [[Git]]
#### 
```bash
git worktree add master
```
##### Create a bare repo and start making new worktrees
###### This means that a copy of the repo files is made for each worktree at the source commit that the bare repo was made from
###### Worktrees make it easier to open multiple repo branches at once under a unified workspace for easy switching of work between multiple features
###### doesn't lend itself to easy updating.
####### The bare repo doesn't `git pull` itself but the worktrees after creation can use `git pull` but this is not ideal. The bare repo is basically frozen at a single commit for all new worktrees made.
