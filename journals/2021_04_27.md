## [[Git]]
### The `git checkout` command was replaced by `git switch` in git v2.23 as `git checkout` was apparently too overloaded.
### **Rebasing:** essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.
#### if you have 2 parallel branches and you rebase 1 onto the other it essentially looks for their common origin point (commit), takes the "base" of that branch and places the base at the end and right on top of branch you're Rebaasing.
#### Then the branch that was the recipient of the rebasing needs to be updated so you rebase that onto the branch that was just rebased. This just moves the pointer to the tip of the merged branches
### **HEAD** is simply the name of the currently checked out commit hash
#### each commit is a pointer to the repo at a point in time
##### each branch is a named pointer to a particular commit
### **Relative References** using `^` and `` to traverse commits in the `git log` so that you don't need to type even the minimum 6 characters of the commit hash.
#### `^` when given the name of a commit hash/branch name it will refer to the parent commit: `main^`
##### These can be stacked too so you can refer to grandparent commit with `main^^`
##### can also use with **HEAD** to traverse from current point: `git checkout HEAD^`
#### `~` will let you specify a number of commits to travel back instead of `git checkout HEAD^^^^` you can use `git checkout HEAD~4` to traverse 4 commits backward
