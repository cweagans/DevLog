### Comparing Sub queries and CTE's there's no real difference.
#### CTE's care recursive whereas sub queries are not
#### CTE's only live for the duration of the execution. If you need that data for multiple queries and it is used in multiple places then you're likely better off using temporary tables.
#####
```sql
WITH myFirstCTE
AS
(
    SELECT * 
	FROM BOA_BAICodes
), mySecondCTE
AS
(
	SELECT TOP 100 *
	FROM myFirstCTE
	WHERE BAI_Code > 100
)
SELECT SUM(CAST(BAI_CODE AS INT)) AS mySum
FROM mySecondCTE
WHERE BAI_Code > 200
```
