> Commonly, one class is similar to another class but with some additions or variations. For example, a store inventory system might use a class called GenericItem having itemName and itemQuantity members. But for produce (fruits and vegetables), a class ProduceItem having itemName, itemQuantity, and expirationDate members may be desired. Note that ProduceItem is really a GenericItem with an additional feature, so ideally a program could define the ProduceItem class as being the same as the GenericItem class but with the addition of an expirationDate member.
