## Public Documentation

<https://www.readthedocs.org>

can link to publix github projects and when you successfully commit into a branch it will rebuild your docs on the readthedocs site.

## Private Docs

In [[s.apps.azure.pipelines]] i can build the docs and return an artifact and deploy that artifact somewhere afterwards
