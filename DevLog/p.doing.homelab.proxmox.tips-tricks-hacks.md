## Tips

In the Server view, the `Datacenter` option is for settings that affect all your nodes. In essence the "tree" view allows setting editing for all children under the parent item.

## VM Templates

When you have a default VM config you like, power down the VM, right click, Convert to template.

It can no longer be used as a VM but you can clone from that template

- Mode:
  - Linked clone: dependent child on the template with cascading downstream changes
  - Full Clone: independent entity
