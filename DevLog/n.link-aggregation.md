[[n.link-aggregation]] or [[n.protocol.lacp]] is the combining two or more separate cabled links into a single logical channel, referred to as an `EtherChannel`
From the host end, this can also be called `NIC teaming`; at the switch end, it can be called `port aggregation`

The term bonding is also widely substituted for aggregation. 
For example, a single network adapter and cable segment might support 1 Gbps; 
bonding this with another adapter and cable segment gives a link of 2 Gbps.
