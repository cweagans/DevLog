## Math Environment

to use LaTeX math you need to create a math environment:

```
$MATH GOES HERE$
```

When rendered this will look like: $MATH GOES HERE$

This is an in-line equation

For a multi-line equation that also centers itself you use double dollars

```
$$MATH GOES HERE$$
```

Rendered it will center: $MATH GOES HERE$
