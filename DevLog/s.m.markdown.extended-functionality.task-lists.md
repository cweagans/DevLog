Using the [[Markdown Lists|s.m.markdown.syntax.lists]] feature, tasks are just an additional syntax on top of the list syntax

## Syntax

```
- [ ] an uncompleted task
- [x] a completed task
	- [ ] an indented uncompleted task
	- [x] an indented completed task	
```

In some processors completing the parent task to children tasks causes formatting such as strike through on sub items of the completed parent:

- [ ] an `uncompleted` task
- [x] a completed task
  - [ ] THIS IS UNCOMPLETED BUT IT'S PARENT IS COMPLETED
  - [x] an indented completed task
