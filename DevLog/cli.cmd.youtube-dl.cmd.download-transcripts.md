## Download transcripts

Might have to change `en` to the desired language such as when the language is listed as `english` for subtitles

```bash
youtube-dl --sub-lang en --write-auto-sub --sub-format vtt --skip-download <URL>
```

- Combine with [THIS](https://gist.github.com/glasslion/b2fcad16bc8a9630dbd7a945ab5ebf5e) to clean the output to `.txt`
