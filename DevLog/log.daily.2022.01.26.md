Did a lot of research and testing of virtual machines in [[p.doing.homelab.proxmox]] trying to see what i can get set up. Looking at trying to get [[p.doing.homelab.services.true-nas]] setup on [[p.doing.homelab.servers.fafnir]] so i can use that as the storage volume for things because at this point stuff is acting weird and im just trying to get something working and operational lol. 

Also got the rest of the unifi gear headed here so i can work on the actual network deployment and use my switch and the dream machine pro to manage the network at a higher level.

Decided i felt like learning more about [[s.db.postgres]] today via [[r.(.2022.01.26.postgres-can-do-that]]

Finishing Work KT story on [[s.db.postgres]] by reviewing [[r.{.2022.01.26.sql_for_data_analytics_perform_fast_and_efficient]]
