## Notes

<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> makes it so documentation can be shown for the keyword your cursor is on.

you can press <kbd>qq</kbd> to return back to your document

and the `keywordprg` variable in vim is the thing that determines what is used for the documentation that is brought up. This is useful for configuring the editor based on filetypes to bring up docs specific to that given language.
