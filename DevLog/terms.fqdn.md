`F`ully `Q`ualified `D`omain `N`ame


An FQDN is made up of the host name and a domain suffix. 

In the example, the host name is `nut` and the domain suffix is `widget.com`. This domain suffix consists of the domain name widget within the top-level domain (TLD) .com. A domain suffix could also contain subdomains between the host and domain name. The trailing dot or period represents the root of the hierarchy.
