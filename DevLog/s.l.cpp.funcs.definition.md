### Definition

The meat of your function. This is where all the body code goes and where you actually perform your coded actions. These are the fleshed out versions of function [[s.l.cpp.funcs#Declaration]]'s.

```cpp
void Hello( string firstName, string lastName ) {
	cout << "Hello " << firstName << " " << lastName << endl;
}
```
