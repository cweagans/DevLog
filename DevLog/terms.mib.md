`M`anagement `I`nformation `B`ase

Holds statistics relating to the activity of the device, such as the number of frames per second handled by a switch. 
Each parameter stored in a MIB is referred to by a numeric Object Identifier (OID).
OIDs are stored within a tree structure. 
Part of the tree is generic to SNMP, while part can be defined by the device vendor.
