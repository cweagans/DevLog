```cpp
/*
	Basic input output
	Send to STDOUT
	endl is like "\n" but better
*/

std::cout << "What are you ending to the terminal?" << std::endl;
//#> What are you ending to the terminal?

std::cin >> myVariable; // "Hello World"

std::cout << "this goes to terminal: " << myVariable << std::endl;
//#> this goes to terminal: Hello World
```
