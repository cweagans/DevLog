  - Model Building Steps:

1. _Define_: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
2. _Fit_: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
3. _Predict_: Just what it sounds like
4. _Evaluate_: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
