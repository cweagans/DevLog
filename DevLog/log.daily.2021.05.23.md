- [[s.apps.vscode]]
  - opening the file search with `CTRL+P` and then typing an `@` will search for _"symbols"_ like Classes, methods, and variables useful for navigating a Table of contents like organization of a code file
  - Right clicking on Classes, Methods, and anything else and using `peek` will let you see the code's definition, declaration, and references for every instance of it's usage
  - Right click and `rename symbol` refactors every instance of that variables name. It's much more efficient that a search and relpace since it's using a logical approach
  - `CTRL+K Z` enters zen mode
