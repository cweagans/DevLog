## Mutators, Accessors, and Private Helpers

> Commonly, a data member has a pair of associated functions: a mutator for setting its value, and an accessor for getting its value, as above. Those functions are also known as a **setter** and **getter** functions, respectively, and typically have names that start with set or get.
