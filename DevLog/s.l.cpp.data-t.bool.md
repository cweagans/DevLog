### Boolean

_booleans can hold the values `true` and `false` that is all._

A great practice for boolean variables would be to name them something beginning with the word _is_ like `isTall` the answer to their question is `true` or `false`. This makes code easier to understand.

```cpp
bool isLarge = true;
bool isNeg   = false;
```
