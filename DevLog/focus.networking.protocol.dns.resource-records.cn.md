`C`anonical `N`ame

(or **alias**) record is used to represent an alias for a host ([[focus.networking.protocol.dns.resource-records.a]] or [[focus.networking.protocol.dns.resource-records.aaaa]]).
For example, the true name of a web server could be masked as the alias `www.` **CNAME** records are also often used to make [[focus.networking.protocol.dns]] administration easier. 
For example, an alias can be redirected to a completely different host temporarily during system maintenance.
