## When to use For loops v.s. While Loops

|    Loop   | Usage                                                                                                                                             |

|  **For**  | _Use when the number of iterations is computable before entering the loop, as when counting down from X to 0, printing a character N times, etc._ |
| **While** | _Use when the number of iterations is not computable before entering the loop, as when iterating until a user enters a particular character._     |
