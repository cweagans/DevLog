### The 'delete' Operator

> The **delete** operator does the opposite of the new operator. The statement `delete pointerVariable`; deallocates a memory block pointed to by pointerVariable, which must have been previously allocated by new. If pointerVariable is null, delete has no effect.

```cpp
new pointerVariable;
delete pointerVariable;
```
