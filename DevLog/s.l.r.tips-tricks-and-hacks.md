## How to add indexed areas to your R script:

```r
# Steps:
# 1.) Add the hashtag in line to start the comment
# 2.) Type what you'd like then space
# 3.) then add 4 dashes "----"
# This will inxes your code area and make it collapsable as well
# the indexed option appears at the bottom of this window 

# PART A ----
print("Hello World")
# PART B ----
```
