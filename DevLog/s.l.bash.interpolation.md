### Interpolation In Bash

- [Variable Interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation)

In computer programming, string interpolation is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values. It is a form of simple template processing or, in formal terms, a form of quasi-quotation.

```shell
#  Documentation
var="theres no place like '$HOME'"
echo "$var"
#> theres no place like /Users/bryanjenks
```
