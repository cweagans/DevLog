#### [[T-SQL Left Join Where Null]]

---

The same as [[T-SQL Left Join|Left Join]] except the left side has records removed from is where are are `NULL`'s in the right side.

So this is saying when joining Women to Men on `MARRIAGE_ID` Where `MARRIAGE_ID IS NULL` means you will only see Married Men Returned. No Single Men and no Women at all.
