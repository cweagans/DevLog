#### [[T-SQL Union]]

---

The `UNION` Operator us useful for combining the records from one table to another.

There must be:
- Same number of columns in both tables
- columns must align with each other and be the same data type

the operator basically does this: 

| TABLE 1       | TABLE 2       | UNION         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ![[#^17b500]] | ![[#^912344]] | ![[#^708f69]] |

```sql
SELECT ID, Value
FROM My_First_Table
UNION
SELECT ID, Value
FROM My_Second_Table
```
