  Generate tags so that you can jump to function definitions
  in a file or in a group of files. tags will also find their
  definitions in other files in the director(ies) it was generated in
  
  To generate tags: `ctags -R .`
  
  this generates a `tags` file and now in your documents you can use
  the following keybindings:
  
  `ctrl-]` jump to definition
  `ctrl-o` go back to prior position
  `ctrl-i` Jump forward
  
  `:h tag-stack` for more info on tags
